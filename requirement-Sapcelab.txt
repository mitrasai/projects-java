1. calculate the focal ratios of the telescope available in lab so they can get the best observations og nebula and stars

2. We need to estimate their weight and age on different planets of the solar system computed by our system


focal ratio = focal length/lens aperture
[dividing the focal length by the lens aperture]
eg: 1000 mm/102 mm

for -> observing moon, planets and double stars => f/10 or more is ideal

for -> observing star clusters, galaxies and mily way => f/7 or less is better

Fromula
-----------------------
1. calculate your age in earth days rather than years
 -> userAge * 365 = ? earthdays
 -> 12 * 365 = 4380 days old

2. Fro Inner Terrestrail Planets
 -> Mercury = 88 earth days (planet orbital period)
 -> Venus = 225 earth days
 -> Mars = 687 earth days

3. Outer Terrestrail Planets
 -> Jupiter = 12 earth years
 -> Saturn = 29.5 earth years
 -> Uranus = 84 earth years
 -> Neptune = 165 earth years 
 -> Pluto = 248 earth years
-------------------------
4. To calculate the weight of the space explorers
 -> by multiplying a person's weight(in pounds or kg) times the relative surface gravity of the planet

wt.of other planet = wt on earth * mulitple of earth's gravity

Mercury -> 0.38
Venus -> 0.91
Mars -> 0.38
Jupiter -> 2.34
Saturn -> 1.06
Uranus -> 0.92
Neptune -> 1.19
