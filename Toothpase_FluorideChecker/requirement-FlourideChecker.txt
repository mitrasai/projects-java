Program Name: Toothpaste Percentage Flouride Checker

1. we need to develop a Toothpaste percentage checker that allows the user to entry a maximum of 2 kinds of Toothpastes to calculate the percentage of Flouride Content and compate them to see which toothpaste has higher flouride content.

2. We must create an login page, so that only authorised users can be able to check. And the final output is displayed in a tabular form

3. Formual:- 
percentage of flouride = (content of flouride present / total paste weight)*100
