"Pet Center Program System for veterinarian doctors" Using Loops

-> This system has been designed and developed with sole objective of analyzing pet's health condition by calculating their resting energy along with maintenance energy requirements.

Requirement:-
---------------
-> Forumla for Resting Energy Requirement(calories/day) is
     1. should consider pet's size(dog/cat)
          small/large -> RER = 70 * (weight of the pet in kg)^0.75
          medium      -> RER = 30 * (weight of the pet in kg)+70

-> Formula for Maintenance Energy Requirement(calorie/day) is
     1. should consider factors of pet type
           MER -> RER * Factor(can be dog/cat)

Factors of dog:-
-----------------
puppy(0-4 years) = 3.0
puppy(4 years - adult) = 2.0
adult - inactive/obese = 1.2
adult - played/neutered = 1.6
adult - inactive = 1.8
adult - weight loss = 1.0
adult - weight gain = 1.7
working dog - light work = 2.0
working dag - moderate work = 3.0
working dog - heavy work = 5.0
senior dog - 1.1

Factors of cat:-
------------------
kitten(0-4 years) = 3.0
kitten(4 years - adult) = 2.0
adult - abese prone = 1.0
adult - neutered = 1.2
adult - not neutered = 1.4
